# Vector Database 101 - Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW)

## Introduction
Duration: 1

Hey there - welcome back to [Milvus tutorials](https://codelabs.milvus.io/). In the previous tutorial, we 

In this tutorial, we'll build on top of that knowledge by looking at what is perhaps the most commonly used primary algorithm today: Hierarchical Navigable Small Worlds (HNSW).

## Wrapping up
Duration: 1

In this tutorial, we did a deep dive into 

In the next tutorial, we'll continue our deep dive into indexing strategies with Approximate Nearest Neighbor Oh Yeah (Annoy) - a tree-based indexing algorithm
